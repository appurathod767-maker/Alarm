# SmartTuneAlarm - Full GitHub-ready Android Studio Project

Package name: `com.appu.smarttunealarmx`

This repository is a GitHub-ready, Codespaces-friendly Android Studio project scaffold for the **SmartTuneAlarm** app.
It includes:
- Jetpack Compose UI with basic navigation and screens
- Room database for saving ringtone URIs
- WorkManager worker scheduled to run at midnight to pick a new ringtone
- Foreground service that plays the ringtone with a gradual fade-in
- Weather service (OpenWeatherMap) stub (add your API key)
- Spotify integration placeholder (requires developer setup)
- `.gitignore`, gradle wrapper properties, and instructions for Codespaces

## Quick start (GitHub -> Codespaces)
1. Create a new GitHub repository and upload the contents of this folder (drag & drop).
2. In GitHub, click **Code -> Codespaces -> Create codespace**.
3. In Codespace terminal, install JDK 17 if needed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y
   ```
4. Build debug APK:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```
   If you don't have the gradle wrapper jar, you can run:
   ```bash
   gradle assembleDebug
   ```
   (Install gradle if necessary.)
5. APK location:
   ```
   app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```

## Local Android Studio
1. Download & unzip.
2. Open in Android Studio -> let Gradle sync.
3. Run on emulator or device.

## Next steps (I can implement these for you)
- Add runtime permissions UI & request flow
- Implement full SAF-based "Add ringtone" flow and delete functionality
- Spotify OAuth & playback integration
- Show weather information in the alarm UI (pull from WeatherService)
- Add theme selection UI and dynamic theme application

## Notes
- Some files (Spotify, API keys) are placeholders and intentionally commented to avoid build failures.
- For the WorkManager exact midnight scheduling, we schedule a periodic worker with initialDelay set to the next midnight.
